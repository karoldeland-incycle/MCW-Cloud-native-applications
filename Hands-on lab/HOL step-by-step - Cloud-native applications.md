# Cloud-native applications - Hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab will guide the student through deploying a web application and API microservice to a Kubernetes platform hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS). In addition, the lab will instruct the student on configuring the behavior of these services through dynamic service discovery, service scale-out, and high availability in the context of AKS-hosted services. By demonstrating crucial Kubernetes concepts, the student will gain experience with the Kubernetes deployment and service resource types. The student will create them manually through the Azure Portal and manipulate their configurations to scale the associated microservice instances up and down and manage their CPU and memory resource allocations with the Kubernetes cluster.

At the conclusion of this lab, you have a solid understanding of how to build and deploy containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and perform common DevOps tasks and procedures.

## Prerequisites

The lab assumes some basic knowledge of Docker containers and Kubernetes. The following modules on Microsoft Learn would be helpful:

| Description | URL |
|-|-|
| Introduction to Docker Containers | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-docker-containers/       |
| Introduction to Containers | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-containers/              |
| Build and Store Container Images| https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-and-store-container-images/ |
| Introduction to Kubernetes | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-kubernetes/              |
|||

Completion of the steps outlined in the [Before the HOL - Cloud-native applications](Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Cloud-native%20applications.md) document is required before undertaking any of the exercises in this lab.

## Overview

Fabrikam Medical Conferences (FabMedical) provides conference website services tailored to the medical community. They are refactoring their application to run as a Docker application. They want to implement a proof of concept that will help them get familiar with the development process, lifecycle of deployment, and critical aspects of the hosting environment. They will be deploying their applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and want to learn how to deploy containers in a dynamically load-balanced manner, discover containers, and scale them on demand.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing this POC with a subset of the application codebase. You will create a build agent based on Linux and an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster for running deployed applications. You will be helping them to complete the Docker setup for their application, test locally, push to an image repository, deploy to the cluster, and test load-balancing and scale.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout these steps, you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with a unique handle (like your Microsoft Account email prefix) to ensure unique names for resources.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully to understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

The proposed containers deployed to the cluster are illustrated below with Cosmos DB as a managed service.

![A diagram showing the solution, using Azure Kubernetes Service with a Cosmos DB back end.](media/solution-topology.png "Solution architecture diagram")

Each tenant will have the following containers:

- **Conference Web site**: The single page application (SPA) application that uses configuration settings to handle custom styles for the tenant.

- **Admin Web site**: The SPA application that conference owners use to manage conference configuration details, attendee registrations, campaigns, and communications with attendees.

- **Registration service**: The API that handles all registration activities creating new conference registrations with the appropriate package selections and associated cost.

- **Email service**: The API that handles email notifications to conference attendees during registration or when the conference owners engage the attendees through their admin site.

- **Config service**: The API that handles conference configuration settings such as dates, locations, pricing tables, early-bird specials, countdowns, and related.

- **Content service**: The API that handles content for the conference, such as speakers, sessions, workshops, and sponsors.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

   - To complete this lab, ensure your account has the following roles:

     - The [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)
       built-in role for the Azure Subscription you will use.

     - Is a [Member](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) user in the Azure AD tenant you will use. (Guest users will not have the necessary permissions.)

   - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Before the Hands-on Lab. This lab requires a minimum of eight cores which may demand more cluster resources than your current quota will allow. In such cases, you can request a CPU core quota increase to deploy the AKS cluster.

2. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

   - A browser, such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

3. You will install other tools throughout the exercises.

> **Very important**: Make sure to type all the commands as they appear in the guide. Do not try to copy and paste to your command windows or other documents when instructed to enter the information shown in this document, except where explicitly stated in this document. There can be issues with Copy and Paste that result in errors, instructions execution, or file content creation.

## Exercise 1: Migrate MongoDB to Cosmos DB using Azure Database Migration Service

**Duration**: 40 minutes

The next step is to migrate the MongoDB database data to Azure Cosmos DB. This exercise will use the Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the data from the MongoDB database into Azure Cosmos DB.

### Task 1: Enable Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider

In this task, you will enable the use of the Azure Database Migration Service within your Azure subscription by registering the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following Azure CLI command to register the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider in your Azure subscription:

   ```sh
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DataMigration
   ```

### Task 2: Provision Azure Database Migration Service

This task will deploy an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service used to migrate the data from MongoDB to Cosmos DB.

1. From the Azure Portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

2. Search the marketplace for **Azure Database Migration Service** and select it.

3. Select **Create**.

    ![The screenshot shows the Azure Database Migration Service in the Azure Marketplace.](media/dms-marketplace-create.png "Azure Database Migration Service")

4. Select the `Migrate my SQL Server, MySQL, PostgresQL, or MongoDB database(s) to Azure` option when prompted.

    ![The screenshot shows a prompt asking which target we plan to use for migration.](media/dms-select-target-type.png "Tell us about the target you plan to use for migration")

5. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Migration Service** pane, enter the following values:

    - **Resource group**: Select the Resource Group created with this lab.
    - **Migration service name**: Enter a name, such as `fabmedical[SUFFIX]`.
    - **Location**: Choose the Azure Region used for the Resource Group.

    ![The screenshot shows the Create Migration Service Basics tab with all values entered.](media/dms-create-basics.png "Create Migration Basics Tab")

6. Select **Next: Networking >>**.

7. On the **Networking** tab, select the **Virtual Network** within the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` resource group.

    ![The screenshot shows the Create Migration Service Networking tab with Virtual Network selected.](media/dms-create-networking.png "Create Migration Service Networking tab")

8. Select **Review + create**.

9. Select **Create** to create the Azure Database Migration Service instance.

It may take 5 to 10 minutes to provision the Azure Database Migration Service instance.

### Task 3: Migrate data to Azure Cosmos DB

In this task, you will create a **Migration project** within Azure Database Migration Service and then migrate the data from MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Navigate to your Build Agent VM in the Azure Portal and copy the Private IP address **(2)**. Then, paste the contents into the text editor of your choice (such as Notepad on Windows, macOS users can use TextEdit) for future use.

   ![Built Agent VM is shown. Overview tab is open. Private IP address is highlighted.](media/agent-vm-private-ip-address.png "Private IP Address")

2. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the **Azure Database Migration Service** created in a previous step..

3. On the Azure Database Migration Service blade, select **+ New Migration Project** on the **Overview** pane.

4. On the **New migration project** pane, enter the following values, then select **Create and run activity**:

    - **Project name**: fabmedical
    - **Source server type**: MongoDB
    - **Target server type**: CosmosDB (MongoDB API)
    - **Choose type of activity**: Offline data migration

    ![The screenshot shows the New migration project pane with values entered.](media/dms-new-migration-project.png "New migration project pane")

    > **Note:** The **Offline data migration** activity type is selected since you will be performing a one-time migration from MongoDB to Cosmos DB. Also, the migration operation will not update data in the database. In a production scenario, you will choose the migration project activity type that best fits your solution requirements.

5. On the **MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB Offline Migration Wizard** pane, enter the following values for the **Select source** tab:

    - **Mode**: Standard mode
    - **Source server name**: Enter the Private IP Address of the Build Agent VM used in this lab.
    - **Server port**: 27017
    - **Require SSL**: Unchecked

    > **Note:** Leave the **User Name** and **Password** blank as the MongoDB instance on the Build Agent VM for this lab does not have authentication turned on. The Azure Database Migration Service resides in the same VNet as the Build Agent VM, so it can communicate within the VNet directly to the VM without exposing the MongoDB service to the Internet. In production scenarios, you should always have authentication enabled on MongoDB.

    ![Select source tab with values selected for the MongoDB server.](media/dms-select-source.png "MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB - Select source")

6. Select **Next: Select target >>**.

7. On the **Select target** pane, select the following values:

    - **Mode**: Select Cosmos DB target

    - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription you're using for this lab.

    - **Select Cosmos DB name**: Select the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` Cosmos DB instance.

    ![The Select target tab with values selected.](media/dms-select-target.png "MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB - Select target")

    Notice, the **Connection String** will automatically populate with the Key for your Azure Cosmos DB instance.

8. Select **Next: Database setting >>**.

10. On the **Database setting** tab, select the `contentdb` **Source Database** so this database from MongoDB will be migrated to Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The screenshot shows the Database setting tab with the contentdb source database selected.](media/dms-database-setting.png "Database setting tab")

11. Select **Next: Collection setting >>**.

12. On the **Collection setting** tab, expand the **contentdb** database, and ensure both the **sessions** and **speakers** collections are selected for migration. Also, update the **Throughput (RU/s)** to `400` for both collections.

    ![The screenshot shows the Collection setting tab with both sessions and speakers collections selected with Throughput RU/s set to 400 for both collections.](media/dms-collection-setting.png "Throughput RU")

13. Select **Next: Migration summary >>**.

14. On the **Migration summary** tab, enter `MigrateData` in the **Activity name** field, then select **Start migration** to initiate the migration of the MongoDB data to Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The screenshot shows the Migration summary is shown with MigrateData entered in the Activity name field.](media/dms-migration-summary.png "Migration summary")

15. The status for the migration activity will be shown. The migration will only take a few seconds to complete. Select **Refresh** to reload the status to ensure it shows a **Status** of **Complete**.

    ![The screenshot shows the MigrateData activity showing the status has completed.](media/dms-migrate-complete.png "MigrateData activity completed")

16. Navigate to the **Cosmos DB Account** for the lab within the Azure Portal to verify the data was migrated, then select the **Data Explorer**. You will see the `speakers` and `sessions` collections listed within the `contentdb` database, and you will be able to explore the documents within.

    ![The screenshot shows the Cosmos DB is open in the Azure Portal with Data Explorer open showing the data has been migrated.](media/dms-confirm-data-in-cosmosdb.png "Cosmos DB is open")

## Exercise 2: Deploy the solution to Azure Kubernetes Service

**Duration**: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will connect to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster you created before the hands-on lab and deploy the Docker application to the cluster.

### Task 1: Tunnel into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

This task will gather the information you need about your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to connect to the cluster and execute commands to connect to the Kubernetes management dashboard from the cloud shell.

> **Note**: The following tasks should be executed in cloud shell and not the build agent VM, so disconnect from build agent VM if still connected.

1. Verify that you are connected to the correct subscription with the following command to show your default subscription:

   ```bash
   az account show
   ```

   - Ensure you are connected to the correct subscription. List your subscriptions and then set the subscription by its id with the following commands (similar to what you did in cloud shell before the lab):

   ```bash
   az account list
   az account set --subscription {id}
   ```

2. Configure kubectl to connect to the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials -a --name fabmedical-SUFFIX --resource-group fabmedical-SUFFIX
   ```

3. Test that the configuration is correct by running a simple kubectl command to produce a list of nodes:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](media/image75.png "kubectl get nodes")

### Task 2: Deploy a service using the Azure Portal

This task will deploy the API application to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using the Azure Portal.

1. Define a new Namespace for our API deployment. Select the **Namespaces** blade of the fabmedical-[SUFFIX] AKS resource detail page of the Azure Portal, and on the Namespaces tab select **+ Add**.

  ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Namespace.](media/create-namespace.png "Add a Namespace")

2. In the **Add with YAML** screen, paste the following YAML and choose **Add**.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: ingress-demo
      name: ingress-demo
    ```

3. Define a Service for our API so that the application is accessible within the cluster. Select the **Services and ingresses** blade of the fabmedical-[SUFFIX] AKS resource detail page of the Azure Portal, and on the Services tab, select **+ Add**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Service.](media/2021-03-25-17-04-04.png "Add a Service")

4. In the **Add with YAML** screen, paste the YAML below and choose **Add**.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
      name: api
      namespace: ingress-demo
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: api-traffic
          port: 3001
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 3001
      selector:
        app: api
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP
    ```

5. Select **Workloads** under the **Kubernetes resources** section in the left navigation.

    ![Select workloads under Kubernetes resources.](media/2021-03-25-17-04-35.png "Select workloads under Kubernetes resources")

6. From the Workloads view, with **Deployments** selected (the default), then select **+ Add**.

    ![Selecting + Add to create a deployment.](media/2021-03-25-17-05-05.png "Selecing + Add to create a deployment")

7. In the **Add with YAML** screen that loads, paste the following YAML and update the `[LOGINSERVER]` placeholder with the name of the ACR instance.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
          app: api
      name: api

            name: api
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            livenessProbe:
              httpGet:
                  path: /
                  port: 3001
              initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSeconds: 20
              timeoutSeconds: 10
              failureThreshold: 3
            ports:
              - containerPort: 3001
                hostPort: 3001
                protocol: TCP
            resources:
              requests:
                  cpu: 1000m
                  memory: 128Mi
            securityContext:
              privileged: false
            terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
            terminationMessagePolicy: File

          schedulerName: default-scheduler
          securityContext: {}
          terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
    ```

8. Select **Add** to initiate the deployment. This can take a few minutes after which you will see the deployment listed.

   ![Service is showing as unhealthy](media/2021-03-25-17-05-36.png "Service is showing as unhealthy")

9. Select the **api** deployment to open the failing Deployment and observe the failing pod.

    ![Pod is showing as unhealthy](media/failing-pod.png "Service pod is showing as unhealthy")

10. Select the failing pod from the list of pods in the `api` deployment and select **Events**.  Observe that the pod is failing to start because the `cosmosdb` secret is not present.

    ![cosmosdb secret is missing](media/missing-secret-event.png "Pod is failing because of a missing secret")

11. Navigate to your resource group in the Azure Portal and find your Cosmos DB. Select the Cosmos DB resource to view details.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the Cosmos DB among existing resources.](media/Ex2-Task1.9.png "Select CosmosDB resource from list")

11. Under **Quick Start** select the **Node.js** tab and copy the **Node.js 3.0 connection string**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the quick start for setting up Cosmos DB with MongoDB API. The copy button is highlighted.](media/Ex2-Task1.10.png "Capture CosmosDB connection string")

12. Modify the copied connection string by adding the database `contentdb` to the URL, along with a replicaSet of `globaldb`. The resulting connection string should look like the below sample. Note that you may need to modify the endpoint URL.

    > **Note**: Username and password redacted for brevity.

    ```text
    mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@fabmedical-<SUFFIX>.documents.azure.com:10255/contentdb?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb
    ```

    > **Note**: This lab has referenced the Cosmos DB API version 3.2. However, if your copied connection string has the endpoint suffix `.mongo.cosmos.azure.com`, feel free to use it, as that will reference the 3.6 API. The lab is compatible with both versions. Here is how the connection string shown above will appear with the 3.6 API:

    ```text
    mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@fabmedical-<SUFFIX>.mongo.cosmos.azure.com:10255/contentdb?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb
    ```


13. You will setup a Kubernetes secret to store the connection string and configure the `content-api` application to access the secret. First, you must base64 encode the secret value. Open your Azure Cloud Shell window and use the following command to encode the connection string and then, copy the output.

    > **Note**: Double quote marks surrounding the connection string are required to successfully produce the required output.

    ```bash
    echo -n "[CONNECTION STRING VALUE]" | base64 -w 0 - | echo $(</dev/stdin)
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure cloud shell window showing the command to create the base64 encoded secret.  The output to copy is highlighted.](media/hol-2019-10-18_07-12-13.png "Show encoded secret")

14. Return to the AKS blade in the Azure Portal and select **Configuration** under the **Kubernetes resources** section. Select **Secrets** and choose **+ Add**.

15. In the **Add with YAML** screen, paste following YAML and replace the placeholder with the encoded connection string from your clipboard and choose **Add**. Note that YAML is position sensitive so you must ensure indentation is correct when typing or pasting.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: cosmosdb
      namespace: ingress-demo
    type: Opaque
    data:
      db: <base64 encoded value>
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS howing the YAML file for creating a deployment.](media/2021-03-25-17-08-06.png "Upload YAML data")

16. Sort the Secrets list by name and you should now see your new secret displayed.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing secrets.](media/find-cosmosdb-secret.png "Manage Kubernetes secrets")

17. View the details for the **cosmosdb** secret by selected it in the list.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing the value of a secret.](media/2021-03-25-17-08-54.png "View cosmosdb secret")

18. Create a new deployment manifest, `api.deployment.yml` and add the YAML content below to the file. Modify the `LOGINSERVER` placeholder for ACR.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical
    code api.deployment.yml
    ```

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
          app: api
      name: api
      namespace: ingress-demo

20. Update the api deployment by using `kubectl` to deploy the API.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete deployment api -n ingress-demo 
    kubectl create -f api.deployment.yml
    ```

21. In the Azure Portal return to Events blade of the deployed pod in the api deployment (see Step 5). The last log should show as connected to MongoDB.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing pod events.](media/2021-03-25-17-09-24.png "Pod Events")

### Task 3: Deploy a service using kubectl

    ```

4. Update the `[LOGINSERVER]` entry to match the name of your ACR Login Server.

5. Select the **...** button and choose **Save**.

   ![In this screenshot of an Azure Cloud Shell editor window, the ... button has been selected and the Save option is highlighted.](media/b4-image62.png "Save Azure Cloud Shell changes")

6. Select the **...** button again and choose **Close Editor**.

    ![In this screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell editor window, the ... button has been selected and the Close Editor option is highlighted.](media/b4-image63.png "Close Azure Cloud Editor")

7. Create a text file called `web.service.yml` in the `~/Fabmedical` folder using the Azure Cloud Shell Editor.

    ```bash
    code web.service.yml
    ```

8. Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

    > **Note**: Be sure to copy and paste only the contents of the code block carefully to avoid introducing any special characters.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service

      selector:
        app: web
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: LoadBalancer
    ```

9. Save changes and close the editor.

10. Execute the commands below to deploy the application described by the YAML files. You will receive a message indicating the items `kubectl` has created a web deployment and a web service.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f web.deployment.yml -f web.service.yml
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl apply -f kubernetes-web.yaml has been typed and run at the command prompt. Messages about web deployment and web service creation appear below.](media/image93.png "kubectl create application")

11. Return to the AKS blade in the Azure Portal. From the navigation menu, under **Kubernetes resources**, select the **Services and ingresses** view. You should be able to access the website via an external endpoint.

    ![AKS services and ingresses shown with External IP highlighted](media/aks-resources-services-ingresses-view.png "AKS services and ingresses shown with External IP highlighted")

12. In the top navigation, select the `speakers` and `sessions` links.

    ![A screenshot of the web site showing no data displayed.](media/Ex2-Task3.11.png "Web site home page")

### Task 4: Review Azure Monitor for Containers

This task will access and review the various logs and dashboards made available by Azure Monitor for Containers.

1. Select the resource group you created named `fabmedical-SUFFIX`, and then choose your `Kubernetes Service` Azure resource from the Azure Portal.

    ![In this screenshot, the resource group was previously selected and the AKS cluster is selected.](media/Ex2-Task8.1.png "Select fabmedical resource group")

2. From the Monitoring blade, select **Insights**.

    ![In the Monitoring blade, Insights is highlighted.](media/Ex2-Task8.2.png "Select Insights link")

3. Review the various available dashboards and take a deeper look at the different metrics and logs available on the Cluster, Nodes, Controllers, and deployed Containers.

    ![In this screenshot, the dashboards and blades are shown. Cluster metrics can be reviewed.](media/Ex2-Task8.3.png "Review the dashboard metrics")

4. To review the Containers dashboards and see more detailed information about each container, select the **Containers** tab.

5. Filter by container name and search for the **web** containers; observe all the containers created in the Kubernetes cluster with the pod names. 

    ![In this screenshot, the containers are filtered by container named web.](media/monitor_1.png "Filter data by container and web")

6. The CPU Usage metric is selected by default, displaying all CPU information for the selected container. To switch to another metric, open the metric dropdown list and select a different metric.

    ![In this screenshot, the various metric options are shown.](media/monitor_2.png "Filter by CPU usage")

7. Upon selecting any pod, the right panel will display all the information related to the chosen metric, which would be the case when selecting any other metric. The portal will show the details on the right panel for the selected pod.

8. To display the logs for any container, simply select it and view the right panel and you will find the "View in Log Analytics" option, which will list all logs for this specific container.

    ![In the View in Analytics dropdown, the View container logs item is selected.](media/monitor_5.png "View container logs menu option")

    ![The container logs are displayed based on a query entered in the query window.](media/monitor_6.png "Container logs")

9. For each log entry you can display more information by expanding the log entry to view the below details.

    ![The container log query results are displayed, one log entry is expanded in the results view with its details shown.](media/monitor_7.png "Expand the results")

## Exercise 3: Scale the application and test HA

**Duration**: 40 minutes

At this point, you have deployed a single instance of the web and API service containers. In this exercise, you will increase the number of container instances for the web service and scale the front-end on the existing cluster.

### Task 1: Increase service instances from the Azure Portal

This task will increase the number of instances for the API deployment in the AKS Azure Portal blade. While it is deploying, you will observe the changing status.

1. In the AKS blade in the Azure Portal, select **Workloads** and then select the **API** deployment.

2. Select **YAML** in the window that loads and scroll down until you find **replicas**. Change the number of replicas to **2**, then select **Review + save**. Finally, check **Confirm manifest change** and select **Save** when prompted.

    ![In the edit YAML dialog, 2 is entered in the desired number of replicas.](media/2021-03-26-16-49-32.png "Setting replicas to 2")

    > **Note**: If the deployment completes quickly, you may not see the deployment Waiting states in the portal, as described in the following steps.

3. From the Replica Set view for the API, you will see it is now deploying and that there is one healthy instance and one pending instance.

    ![Replica Sets is selected under Workloads in the navigation menu on the left, and at right, Pods status: 1 pending, 1 running is highlighted. Below that, a red arrow points at the API deployment in the Pods box.](media/api-replica-set.png "View replica details")

4. From the navigation menu, select **Workloads**. Note that the api Deployment has an alert and shows a pod count 1 of 2 instances (shown as `1/2`).

    ![In the Deployments box, the api service is highlighted with a grey timer icon at left and a pod count of 1/2 listed at right.](media/2021-03-26-16-50-38.png "View api active pods")

    > **Note**: If you receive an error about insufficient CPU, that is OK. We will see how to deal with this in the next Task (Hint: you can use the **Insights** option in the AKS Azure Portal to review the **Node** status and view the Kubernetes event logs).

    At this point, here is a health overview of the environment:

    - One Deployment and one Replica Set are each healthy for the web service.

    - The api Deployment and Replica Set are in a warning state.

    - Two pods are healthy in the 'ingress-demo' namespace.

5. Open the Contoso Neuro Conference web application. The application should still work without errors as you navigate to Speakers and Sessions pages.

   - Navigate to the `/stats` page. You will see information about the hosting environment including:

     - **webTaskId:** The task identifier for the web service instance.

     - **taskId:** The task identifier for the API service instance.

     - **hostName:** The hostname identifier for the API service instance.

     - **pid:** The process id for the API service instance.

     - **mem:** Some memory indicators returned from the API service instance.

     - **counters:** Counters for the service itself, as returned by the API service instance.

     - **uptime:** The up time for the API service.

### Task 2: Resolve failed provisioning of replicas

This task will resolve the failed API replicas. These failures occur due to the clusters' inability to meet the requested resources.

1. In the AKS blade in the Azure Portal select **Workloads** and then select the **API** deployment. Select the **YAML** navigation item.

2. In the **YAML** screen scroll down and change the following items:

    - Modify **ports** and remove the **hostPort**. Two Pods cannot map to the same host port.

      ```yaml
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3001
          protocol: TCP
      ```

    - Modify the **cpu** and set it to **100m**. CPU is divided between all Pods on a Node.

      ```yaml
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
      ```

   Select **Review + save** and, when prompted, confirm the changes, and select **Save**.

      ![In the edit YAML dialog, showing two changes required.](media/2021-03-26-16-56-28.png "Modify deployment manifest")

3. Return to the **Workloads** main view on the AKS Azure Portal and observe that the Deployment has two healthy Pods.

    ![In the Workload view with the API deployment highlighted.](media/healthy-deployment.png "API deployment is now healthy")

### Task 3: Restart containers and test HA

This task will restart containers and validate that the restart does not impact the running service.

1. Open the sample web application and navigate to the "Stats" page as shown.

    ![The Stats page is visible in this screenshot of the Contoso Neuro web application.](media/image123.png "Contoso web task details")

2. Navigate to the api Deployment of the fabmedical-[SUFFIX] AKS cluster in the Azure Portal. Open the YAML via the **YAML** blade and increase the required replica count to `4` in the api Deployment YAML. (See steps in Exercise 4, Task 1).

    ![In the left menu the Deployments item is selected. The API deployment is highlighted in the Deployments list box.](media/2021-03-26-17-30-28.png "API pod deployments")

3. After a few moments, you will find that the API deployment is running four replicas successfully.

4. Return to the browser tab with the web application stats page loaded. Refresh the page over and over. Observe that the api hostname periodically changes between the four api pod instances. Likewise, the task id and pid might also switch between the four api pod instances.

    ![On the Stats page in the Contoso Neuro web application, two different api host name values are highlighted.](media/image126.png "View web task hostname")

5. After refreshing enough times to see that the `hostName` value is changing and the service remains healthy, you can open the **Replica Sets** view for the API in the Azure Portal.

6. On this view, you can see that the hostname value shown in the web application stats page matches the pod names for the pods running.

    ![Viewing replica set in the Azure Portal.](media/2021-03-26-17-31-02.png "Viewing replica set in the Azure Portal")

7. Select two of the Pods at random and choose **Delete**. Select **Confirm delete**, and press **Delete** again.

    ![The context menu for a pod in the pod list is expanded with the Delete item selected.](media/2021-03-26-17-31-31.png "Delete running pod instance")

8. Kubernetes will launch new Pods to meet the required replica count. Depending on your view, you may see the old instances in the Terminating state and new instances in the ContainerCreating state.

    ![The first row of the Pods box is highlighted, and the pod has a green check mark and is running.](media/2021-03-26-17-31-54.png "API Pods changing state")

9. Return to the API Deployment and scale it back to a value of `1` replica. See Step 2 above for how to do this if you are unsure.

10. Return to the sample website's stats page in the browser and refresh while Kubernetes scales down the number of Pods. You will notice that only one API hostname shows up, even though you may still see several running pods in the API replica set view. This behavior is because Kubernetes will no longer send traffic to the pods it has selected to terminate, even though several pods are running. As a result, only one pod will show in the API Replica Set view in a few moments.

    ![Replica Sets is selected under Workloads in the navigation menu on the left. On the right are the Details and Pods boxes. Only one API host name, which has a green check mark and is listed as running, appears in the Pods box.](media/2021-03-26-17-32-24.png "View replica details")

### Task 4: Configure Cosmos DB Autoscale

This task will set up Autoscaling on Azure Cosmos DB.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` **Azure Cosmos DB Account**.

2. Select **Data Explorer**.

3. Within **Data Explorer**, expand the `contentdb` database, then expand the `sessions` collection.

4. Under the `sessions` collection, select **Scale & Settings**.

5. On the **Scale & Settings**, select **Autoscale** for the **Throughput** setting under **Scale**.

    ![The screenshot displays Cosmos DB Scale and Settings tab with Autoscale selected](media/cosmosdb-autoscale.png "CosmosDB collection scale and settings")

6. Select **Save**.

7. Perform the same operation on the `speakers` collection to enable **Autoscale** on it.

### Task 5: Test Cosmos DB Autoscale

This task will run a performance test script that will test the Autoscale feature of Azure Cosmos DB so you can see that it will now scale greater than 400 RU/s.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` **Cosmos DB account**.

2. Select **Connection String** under **Settings**.

3. On the **Connection String** pane, copy the **HOST**, **USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values from the **Read-write Keys** selector. Save these for use later.

    ![The Cosmos DB account Connection String pane with the fields to copy highlighted.](media/cosmos-connection-string-pane.png "View CosmosDB connection string")

    >**Note**: In your Cosmos DB account, you may see that the host endpoint uses `.mongo.cosmos.azure.com`, which is for version 3.6 of Mongo DB. The endpoint shown here is `.documents.azure.com`, which is for version 3.2 of Mongo DB. You can use either endpoint for the purposes of this Task. If you are curious about the new features added to version 3.6 (that do not affect the application in this lab), consult [this](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/upgrade-your-server-version-from-3-2-to-3-6-for-azure-cosmos-db-api-for-mongodb/) post.

4. Open the Azure Cloud Shell, and **SSH** to the **Build agent VM**.

5. On the **Build agent VM**, navigate to the `~/Fabmedical` directory.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical
    ```

6. Run the following command to open the `perftest.sh` script for editing in Vi.

    ```bash
    vi perftest.sh
    ```

7. There are several variables declared at the top of the `perftest.sh` script. Modify the **host**, **username**, and **password** variables by setting their values to the corresponding Cosmos DB Connection String values that were copied previously.

    ![The screenshot shows Vim with perftest.sh file open and variables set to Cosmos DB Connection String values.](media/cosmos-perf-test-variables.png "Modify the connection information in Vim")

    > Press `i` on your keyboard to enter insert mode, where you can alter the file.

8. Save the file and exit Vim.

    > You can do this by pressing the `Esc` key on your keyboard, followed by `:wq`.

9. Run the following command to execute the `perftest.sh` script to run a small load test against Cosmos DB. This script will consume RU's in Cosmos DB by inserting many documents into the Sessions container.

    ```bash
    bash ./perftest.sh
    ```

    > **Note:** The script will take a minute to complete executing.

10. Once the script has completed, navigate back to the **Cosmos DB account** in the Azure portal.

11. Scroll down on the **Overview** pane of the **Cosmos DB account** blade and locate the **Request Charge** graph.

    > **Note:** It may take 2 - 5 minutes for the activity on the Cosmos DB collection to appear in the activity log. Wait a few minutes and refresh the pane if the recent Request charge doesn't show up immediately.

12. Notice that the **Request charge** now shows there was activity on the **Cosmos DB account** that exceeded the 400 RU/s limit that was previously set before Autoscale was turned on.

    ![The screenshot shows the Cosmos DB request charge graph showing recent activity from performance test](media/cosmos-request-charge.png "Recent CosmosDB activity graph")

## Exercise 4: Working with services and routing application traffic

**Duration**: 120 minutes

In the previous exercise, we restricted the scale properties of the service. This exercise will configure the api deployments to create pods that use dynamic port mappings to eliminate the port resource constraint during scale activities.

Kubernetes services can discover the ports assigned to each pod, allowing you to run multiple pod instances on the same agent node --- something that is not possible when you configure a specific static port (such as 3001 for the API service).

### Task 1: Update an external service to support dynamic discovery with a load balancer

In this task, you will update the web service to support dynamic discovery through an Azure load balancer.

1. From AKS **Kubernetes resources** menu, select **Deployments** under **Workloads**. From the list, select the **web** deployment.

2. Select **YAML**, then select the **JSON** tab.

3. Locate the replicas node and update the required count to a value of `4`.

4. Next, scroll to the web containers spec as shown in the screenshot. Remove the hostPort entry for the web container's port mapping.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Edit a Deployment dialog box with various displayed information about spec, containers, ports, and env. The ports node, containerPort: 3001 and protocol: TCP are highlighted, along with the increase to 4 replicas.](media/update-web-deployment.png "Remove web container hostPort entry")

5. Select **Review + save** and then confirm the change and **Save**.

6. Check the status of the scale out by refreshing the web deployment's view. From the navigation menu, select Pods from under Workloads. Select the web pods. You should see an error like that shown in the following screenshot from this view.

    ![Deployments is selected under Workloads in the navigation menu on the left. On the right are the Details and New Replica Set boxes. The web deployment is highlighted in the New Replica Set box, indicating an error.](media/2021-03-26-18-23-38.png "View Pod deployment events")

Like the API deployment, the web deployment used a fixed _hostPort_, and the number of available agent nodes limited your ability to scale. However, after resolving this issue for the web service by removing the _hostPort_ setting, the web deployment cannot scale past two pods due to CPU constraints. The deployment requests more CPU than the web application needs; we will fix this constraint in the next task.

### Task 2: Adjust CPU constraints to improve scale

This task will modify the CPU requirements for the web service to scale out to more instances.

1. Re-open the JSON view for the web deployment and then find the **CPU** resource requirements for the web container. Change this value to `125m`.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Edit a Deployment dialog box with various displayed information about ports, env, and resources. The resources node, with cpu: 125m selected, is highlighted.](media/2021-03-26-18-24-06.png "Change cpu value")

2. Select **Review + save**, confirm the change, and select **Save** to update the deployment.

3. From the navigation menu, select **Replica Sets** under **Workloads**. From the view's Replica Sets list select the web replica set.

4. Observe four web pods in the running state when the deployment update completes.

    ![Four web pods are listed in the Pods box, and all have green check marks and are listed as Running.](media/2021-03-26-18-24-35.png "Four pods running")

### Task 3: Perform a rolling update

This task will edit the web application source code to add Application Insights and update the Docker image used by the deployment. Then you will perform a rolling update to demonstrate how to deploy a code change.

1. Execute this command in Azure Cloud Shell to retrieve the instrumentation key for the `content-web` Application Insights resource:

    ```bash
    az resource show -g fabmedical-[SUFFIX] -n content-web --resource-type "Microsoft.Insights/components" --query properties.InstrumentationKey -o tsv
    ```

    Copy this value. You will use it later.

    > **Note**: We must execute commands for this and later steps from an Azure Cloud Shell terminal that does not have an active SSH session with the build agent VM. This step and the following steps require the existence of the `api.deployment.yml`, `web.deployment.yml`, and `web.service.yml` files in your `~/Fabmedical` repository root; we should have generated these files in the `~/Fabmedical` repository root via previous steps in this lab from your Azure Cloud Shell terminal, and not on the build agent VM. If these files are not present at that location, please review previous lab steps up to this point and ensure the creation of these files in the correct place before proceeding.

2. From an Azure Cloud Shell terminal that does **NOT** have an active SSH session to the build agent VM update your Fabmedical repository files by pulling the latest changes from the git repository and then updating deployment YAML files.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical/content-web
    kubectl get deployment api -n ingress-demo -o=yaml > api.deployment.yaml
    kubectl get deployment web -n ingress-demo -o=yaml > web.deployment.yaml
    git pull
    ```

    > **Note**: The calls to `kubectl` are necessary to fetch recent changes to the port and CPU resource configurations made in previous steps for the `web` and `api` deployments.

3. Install support for Application Insights.

    ```bash
    npm install applicationinsights --save
    ```

    > **Note**: Make sure to include the `--save` argument. Without this, a reference to the `applicationinsights` npm package will not get added to the `package.json` file of the `content-web` nodejs project, resulting in a deployment failure in later steps.

4. Edit the `app.js` file using Vim or Visual Studio Code remote and add the following lines immediately after `express` is instantiated on line 6:

    ```javascript
    const appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
    appInsights.setup("[YOUR APPINSIGHTS KEY]");
    appInsights.start();
    ```

    ![A screenshot of the code editor showing updates in context of the app.js file](media/hol-2019-10-02_12-33-29.png "AppInsights updates in app.js")

5. Save changes and close the editor.

6. Add the following entries to the path triggers in the `content-web.yml` workflow file in the `.github/workflows` folder.

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches:
        - main
        paths:
        - 'content-api/**'
        - web.deployment.yml  # These two file
        - web.service.yml     # entries here
    ```

7. Uncomment the following task in the `content-web.yml` workflow file in the `.github/workflows` folder. Be sure to indent the YAML formatting of the task to be consistent with the formatting of the existing file.

    ```yaml 
          - name: Deploy to AKS
            uses: azure/k8s-deploy@v1
            with:
              manifests: |
                web.deployment.yml
                web.service.yml
              images: |
                ${{ env.containerRegistry }}/${{ env.imageRepository }}:${{ env.tag }}
              imagepullsecrets: |
                ingress-demo-secret
              namespace: ingress-demo
    ```

8. Add the following entries to the path triggers in the `content-api.yml` workflow file in the `.github/workflows` folder.

    ```yaml

        - api.deployment.yml  # These two file
        - api.service.yml     # entries here
    ```

9. Uncomment the following tasks in the `content-api.yml` workflow file in the `.github/workflows` folder. Be sure to indent the YAML formatting of the task to be consistent with the formatting of the existing file.

    ```yaml
          - uses: Azure/aks-set-context@v1
            with:
              creds: '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}'

    ```

    > **Note**: Ensure the following files from [Exercise 2](#exercise-2-deploy-the-solution-to-azure-kubernetes-service), Tasks [2](#task-2-deploy-a-service-using-the-azure-portal) and [3](#task-3-deploy-a-service-using-kubectl), are present in the git repository root.

    ```bash
    api.deployment.yml
    web.deployment.yml
    web.service.yml
    ```

10. Push these changes to your repository so that GitHub Actions CI will build and deploy a new Container image.

   ```bash
   git add .
   kubectl delete deployment web -n ingress-demo
   kubectl delete deployment api -n ingress-demo
   git commit -m "Added Application Insights"
   git push
   ```

11. Visit the `content-web` and `content-api` Actions for your GitHub Fabmedical repository and observe the images being built and deployed into the Kubernetes cluster.

12. While the pipelines rune, return the Azure Portal in the browser.

13. From the navigation menu, select **Replica Sets** under **Workloads**. From this view, you will see a new replica set for the web, which may still be in the process of deploying (as shown below) or already fully deployed.

    ![At the top of the list, a new web replica set is listed as a pending deployment in the Replica Set box.](media/2021-03-26-18-25-30.png "Pod deployment is in progress")

14. While the deployment is in progress, you can navigate to the web application and visit the stats page at `/stats`. Refresh the page as the rolling update executes. Observe that the service is running normally, and tasks continue to be load balanced.

    ![On the Stats page, the hostName is highlighted.](media/image145.png "On Stats page hostName is displayed")

### Task 4: Configure Kubernetes Ingress

This task will set up a Kubernetes Ingress using an [Nginx proxy server](https://nginx.org/en/) to take advantage of path-based routing and TLS termination.

1. Run the following command from an Azure Cloud Shell terminal to add the Nginx stable Helm repository:

    ```bash
    helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
    ```

2. Update your helm package list.

   ```bash
   helm repo update
   ```

   > **Note**: If you get a "no repositories found." error, then run the following command. This will add back the official Helm "stable" repository.
   >
   > ```bash
   > helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable 
   > ```

3. Install the Ingress Controller resource to handle ingress requests as they come in. The Ingress Controller will receive a public IP of its own on the Azure Load Balancer and handle requests for multiple services over ports 80 and 443.

   ```bash
   helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-demo \
    --set controller.replicaCount=2 \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
   ```

4. In the Azure Portal under **Services and ingresses**, copy the IP Address for the **External IP** for the `nginx-ingress-RANDOM-nginx-ingress` service.

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing the ingress controller settings.](media/2021-03-26-18-26-13.png "Copy ingress controller settings")

    > **Note**: It could take a few minutes to refresh, alternately, you can find the IP using the following command in Azure Cloud Shell.
    >
    > ```bash
    > kubectl get svc --namespace ingress-demo
    > ```
    >
   ![A screenshot of Azure Cloud Shell showing the command output.](media/Ex4-Task5.5a.png "View the ingress controller LoadBalancer")

5. Open the [Azure Portal Resource Groups blade](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customPortal=false#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups) and locate the Resource Group automatically created to host the Node Pools for AKS. It will have the naming format of `MC_fabmedical-[SUFFIX]_fabmedical-[SUFFIX]_[REGION]`.

6. Within the Azure Cloud Shell, create a script to update the public DNS name for the external ingress IP.

   ```bash
   cd ~/Fabmedical
   code update-ip.sh
   ```

   Paste the following as the contents. Be sure to replace the following placeholders in the script:

   - **[INGRESS PUBLIC IP]**: Replace this with the IP Address copied from step 5.
   - **[AKS NODEPOOL RESOURCE GROUP]**: Replace with the name of the Resource Group copied from step 6.
   - **[SUFFIX]**: Replace this with the same SUFFIX value used previously for this lab.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Public IP address
   IP="[INGRESS PUBLIC IP]"

   # Resource Group that contains AKS Node Pool
   KUBERNETES_NODE_RG="[AKS NODEPOOL RESOURCE GROUP]"

   # Name to associate with public IP address
   DNSNAME="fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress"

   # Get the resource-id of the public ip
   PUBLICIPID=$(az network public-ip list --resource-group $KUBERNETES_NODE_RG --query "[?ipAddress!=null]|[?contains(ipAddress, '$IP')].[id]" --output tsv)

   # Update public ip address with dns name
   az network public-ip update --ids $PUBLICIPID --dns-name $DNSNAME
   ```

   ![A screenshot of cloud shell editor showing the updated IP and SUFFIX values.](media/Ex4-Task5.6.png "Update the IP and SUFFIX values")

7. Save changes and close the editor.

8. Run the update script.

   ```bash
   bash ./update-ip.sh
   ```

9. Verify the IP update by visiting the URL in your browser.

    > **Note**: It is normal to receive a 404 message at this time.

    ```text
    http://fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com/
    ```

    ![A screenshot of the fabmedical browser URL.](media/Ex4-Task5.9.png "fabmedical browser URL")

10. Use helm to install `cert-manager`, a tool that can provision SSL certificates automatically from letsencrypt.org.

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace cert-manager
    kubectl label namespace cert-manager cert-manager.io/disable-validation=true
    kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.1/cert-manager.yaml
    ```

11. Create a custom `ClusterIssuer` resource for the `cert-manager` service to use when handling requests for SSL certificates.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical
    code clusterissuer.yml
    ```

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    spec:
      acme:
        # The ACME server URL
        server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        # Email address used for ACME registration
        email: user@fabmedical.com
        # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
        privateKeySecretRef:
          name: letsencrypt-prod
        # Enable HTTP01 validations
        solvers:
        - http01:
            ingress:
              class: nginx
    ```

12. Save changes and close the editor.

13. Create the issuer using `kubectl`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f clusterissuer.yml
    ```

14. Now you can create a certificate object.

    > **Note**:
    >
    > Cert-manager might have already created a certificate object for you using ingress-shim.
    >
    > To verify that the certificate was created successfully, use the `kubectl describe certificate tls-secret` command.
    >
    > If a certificate is already available, skip to step 16.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical
    code certificate.yml
    ```

    Use the following as the contents and update the `[SUFFIX]` and `[AZURE-REGION]` to match your ingress DNS name.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: tls-secret
    spec:
      secretName: tls-secret
      dnsNames:
        - fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com
      issuerRef:
        name: letsencrypt-prod
        kind: ClusterIssuer
    ```

15. Save changes and close the editor.

16. Create the certificate using `kubectl`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f certificate.yml
    ```

    > **Note**: To check the status of the certificate issuance, use the `kubectl describe certificate tls-secret` command and look for an _Events_ output similar to the following:
    >
    > ```text
    > Type    Reason         Age   From          Message
    > ----    ------         ----  ----          -------
    > Normal  Generated           38s   cert-manager  Generated new private key
    > Normal  GenerateSelfSigned  38s   cert-manager  Generated temporary self signed certificate
    > Normal  OrderCreated        38s   cert-manager  Created Order resource "tls-secret-3254248695"
    > Normal  OrderComplete       12s   cert-manager  Order "tls-secret-3254248695" completed successfully
    > Normal  CertIssued          12s   cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
    > ```

    It can take between 5 and 30 minutes before the tls-secret becomes available. This is due to the delay involved with provisioning a TLS cert from letsencrypt.

17. Now you can create an ingress resource for the content applications.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical
    code content.ingress.yml
    ```

    Use the following as the contents and update the `[SUFFIX]` and `[AZURE-REGION]` to match your ingress DNS name:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: content-ingress
      namespace: ingress-demo
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
        cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
          - fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com
        secretName: tls-secret
      rules:
      - host: fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /(.*)
            backend:
              serviceName: web
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /content-api/(.*)
            backend:
              serviceName: api
              servicePort: 3001
    ```

18. Save changes and close the editor.

19. Create the ingress using `kubectl`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f content.ingress.yml
    ```

20. Refresh the ingress endpoint in your browser. You should be able to visit the speakers and sessions pages and see all the content.

21. Visit the API directly, by navigating to `/content-api/sessions` at the ingress endpoint.

    ![A screenshot showing the output of the sessions content in the browser.](media/Ex4-Task5.19.png "Content api sessions")

22. Test TLS termination by visiting both services again using `https`.

    > **Note**: It can take between 5 and 30 minutes before the SSL site becomes available. This is due to the delay involved with provisioning a TLS cert from letsencrypt.

## After the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will de-provision any Azure resources created in support of this lab.

1. Delete the Resource Groups in which you placed all your Azure resources.

   - From the Portal, navigate to the blade of your **Resource Group** and then select **Delete** in the command bar at the top.

   - Confirm the deletion by re-typing the resource group name and selecting Delete.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
